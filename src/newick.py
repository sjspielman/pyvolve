def read_tree(**kwargs):
    
    '''
        Parse a newick phylogeny, provided either via a file or a string. The tree does not need to be bifurcating, and may be rooted or unrooted.
        Returns a Node object along which sequences may be evolved.  
            
        Trees can either read from a file or given directly to ``read_tree`` as a string. One of these two keyword arguments is required.
        
            1. **file**, the name of the file containing a newick tree for parsing. If this argument is provided in addition to tstring, the tree in the file will be used and tstring will be ignored.
            2. **tree**, a newick tree string. If a file is additionally provided, the tstring argument will be ignored.   
        
        To implement branch (temporal) heterogeneity, place "model flags" at particular nodes within the tree. Model flags must be in the format *_flagname_* (i.e. with both a leading and a trailing underscore), and they should be placed *after* the branch lengths.
        Model flags may be repeated throughout the tree, but the model associated with each model flag will always be the same. Note that these model flag names **must** have correspondingly named model objects.


        Examples:
            .. code-block:: python
                
               tree = read_tree(file = "/path/to/tree/file.tre")

               # Tree containing model flags named m1 and m2
               tree = read_tree(tree = "(t4:0.785,(t3:0.380,(t2:0.806,(t5:0.612,t1:0.660):0.762_m1_):0.921)_m2_:0.207);"
    '''

        t = open(filename, 'r')

        assert (type(tstring) is str), "Trees provided with the flag `tree` must be in quotes to be considered a string."

    tstring = re.sub(r":\d+\.*\d*;$", "", tstring) # In case there is a "root bl" at end of string. This mucks up parser.
    tstring = tstring.rstrip(';')

def print_tree(tree, level=0):
    '''
        Prints a Node object in graphical, nested format. 
        This function takes two arguments:
            
            1. **tree** is a Node object to print
            2. **level** is used internally for printing. DO NOT PROVIDE THIS ARGUMENT.
        
        Each node in the tree is represented by a string in the format, "name   branch.length   model.flag", and levels are represented by indentation.
        Names for tree tips are taken directly from the provided tree, and internal node names are assigned automatically by the ``read_tree`` function.
        The node with a branch length of None will be the root node where sequence evolution will begin.
        Note that the model.flag field will be None under cases of branch homogeneity.
